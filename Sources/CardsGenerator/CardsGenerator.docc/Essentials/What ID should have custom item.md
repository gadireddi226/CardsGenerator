# What ID should have custom item generated by user

Well good question, it's your responsibility.
## Overview
At the moment the custom items do not have ids on backend. So it is your job to use some hashing function and pass it as ``IdentifiableObject`` to the service.
>Note: For example the hash for cutom item could be [sha256](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cryptokit/sha256) if it is not overkill.

Once you get the prioritized items from the service you should map ids back to the custom items again in your app.
